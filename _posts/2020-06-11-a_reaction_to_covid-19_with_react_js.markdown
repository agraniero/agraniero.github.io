With so many people negatively affected by the COVID-19 epidemic it seemed reasonable that a way to connect those with an abundance of resources to those in need be facilitated.  What better way to connect folks than an internet message board!

For my final project I chose to implement a simple, but super quick, message board with React.js and Redux.  Moving from vanilla Javascript to React's component-based model made rendering data easy and reactive.  What began as a difficult framework to grasp now feels  more intuitive than anything else I've used thus far.  I look forward to working with React.js on an industrial level in the furture.
