#		 For my Rails project I chose to extend the functionality of the to-do list MVC I built in Sinatra.  I added the ability to have multiple lists, name them, and add items to those lists.  With the help of Rails’ impressive generators the creation of most of my application was instant.  Then include the extended assistance of Ruby Gems like BCrypt and Omniauth, and securely encrypting a user’s password data or easily verifying a person’s login credentials- easily configured.  I enjoyed Rails and look forward to what I’ll be able to build with it in the future.
