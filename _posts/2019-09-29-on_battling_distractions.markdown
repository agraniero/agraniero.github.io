***Don’t do it.  Why stay focused anyway?  The occasional cat (or whatever) meme, or gif, spree can be therapeutic when living in the modern world, in my personal opinion.  Have a job?  No problem.  Have kids?  Okay.  Just do what you need to do, and do it with concentrated effort.  Should you still have time to learn coding, you’re better than a rockstar.  Be proud of yourself, you socially awkward geek-nerd-person.  It's what I'm trying to do too, <3.***

I do love me some cat gifs though...

And finally, since I should give at least visual credit to whom I was inspired by when composing this blog, here's one of my old school influences... with concatenation:
