For my JavaScript portfolio project I wanted to make something that would be helpful- something contributive to my life and the lives of others, and since I can be fairly indecisive at times, I thought I should probably build a Magic 8-Ball replica to help out with making weekend plans!  

I forged my digital diviniation machine with a Rails API backend and super quick JS frontend.   Users enter their desired question, click the 'shake' button, and... PRESTO!!! They then receive one of the twenty original responses given by that lovable kids' toy that's been around since the 1950's. 

As has been the trend thus far, I've gained a much deeper understanding of the programming languages used in this project while working on it.
